Rasa Novum's Ender Siphon (Working Name) Mod allows players to easily construct the mega-builds of their dreams. With the Ender Siphon (Working Name), players can build without the need to resupply blocks from their storage, as it will automatically top-up the blocks stored in the Ender Siphon (Working Name) as the player uses them.
